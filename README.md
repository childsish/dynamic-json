dynamic-json
============

Created to allow .json files to behave a little more like configuration files. This is done by allowing json entries to refer to each other. Requires fewer dependencies than dynamic-pyyaml, but lacks all the nice features of the yaml specification.

## Installation

Just drop dynamic_json.py wherever you need it.

## Usage

Examine the test and example configuration file that can be found in the repository. It should be self-explanatory.
